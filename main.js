// Write a function feedCat() that takes two arguments: 
// paramater one - a string representing if the cat is "asleep", "playful" or "sad" 
// parameter two- a number with a range of 0 to 3 representing how many times the cat has been fed that day 

// Your function should return True or False based on the following criteria.

// You should not feed the cat if he is asleep even if he has not been fed that day - return false
// You should not feed the cat if he has been fed 3 times or more today - return false

// You should feed the cat if it is playful and has been fed less than 2 times today - return true
// You should feed the cat if it is sad and has been fed less than 3 times today - return true


//example feedCat(sad,2) should return true
//example feedCat(playful,2) should return false

//Bonus Task. If the cat is not asleep, playful or sad it is not in a valid state! return the following string "Cat can only be asleep, playful or sad" if the first parameter is not asleep, playful or sad


export function feedCat(catState, numberOfTimesCatHasEaten) {
    // Code here. Good luck!
}
